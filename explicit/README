Call 'jsim' without filename.
   Then a file chooser window will be popped up. 
   Three kind of file formats can be chosed: 
      <file>.tbf  steps through LPE (like msim) 
      <file>.aut  navigates through Labeled Transition System
      <file>.trc  like .tbf, in addition traces will be read
		  the targets are displayed in the marked transion 
		  table

call "jsim <file>[.tbf|.aut|.trc]" 
      Then <file> will be read and 'jsim' starts
