Todo list:

1. Tidy up the source code
2. aut2svc: requires labels to be either quoted strings or unquoted i
   This is too limited
3. The invisible action in svc files is tau instead of the CADP standard i
   Conversion tools should convert i <-> tau
4. Output files must be written to the current directory and not to the directory
   where the input file resides
