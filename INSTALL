The software is distributed under a license agreement in
the file LICENSE. This licence enforces proper acknowledgement
of the authors of the software, and excludes any liability or 
obligation of any kind. The software may only be installed and
used under this license.

0 Distribution is made for SunOs, Linux, and Darwin. 
    Verify that your system contains the following software.
    tcl (7.4 or higher)
    tk (4.0 or higher)
  If not and you want use the simulator, 
  then install those packages first.
  
  Verify that the variable OPENWINHOME is defined on a sun.

1 Go to the top directory.

2 Enter the command './configure [ --prefix "install dir" ]'
   "install dir" is the directory on which you want to install the
    toolset. The sub directories are lib, bin, include, and share. 
    The default "install dir" is the home directory if the $USER is not
    equal to root, /usr/local otherwise .
    Default  will be used the aterm library version 2.3, which is part of this 
    distribution. Alternatively a seperate aterm library can be used
    by entering the command
      './configure --with-aterm=<parent directory of "lib" and "include">'
    
    There is assumed that the tcl/tk libraries are found in the subdirectory
    "lib" of the parent of the directory in which "wish" is located,
    the include files belonging to these libraries are expected to be found in
    the subdirectory "include" which is a neighbour of "lib".
    If this is not the case then enter the command:
    './configure [ --prefix "install dir" ] --with-tcldir="tcldir"
	--with-tkdir="tkdir"'
    where "tcldir" and "tkdir" are the directories where respectively
    tcl and tk are installed.
    
    If you want the cc compiler instead of gcc, then use the flag:
    --enable-cc at the call of ./configure.

3 Then type "make install" on  Linux OS or Darwin,  
  or "gmake install" otherwise.

4 The subdirectories are cleaned by entering the command "make clean".
  "make uninstall" uninstalls the package.
  
5 Tutorials about the mcrl toolset can be found in  ${prefix}/share/doc

6 You can define the following variables in a file named "config.site":
    CFLAGS, LDFLAGS, DYNFLAGS (extra load flags needed for the rewriter),
    prefix (the place of "install dir"), TCLDIR, and TKDIR
    (the places of respectively tcl directory and tk directory)
    Don't forget to assign to the shell variable CONFIG_SITE
    the path to config.site. 

7 Complete information about the flag of ./configure can be obtained by
    ./configure --help

8 A test run can be started by entering "make test" in the top_directory.

9 If you want to use the simulators (msim) with the ability to display control 
  flow graphs, jsim or you want to to display flow control graphs by the 
  command "stategraph -stateview" then java.1.4, and dot must be 
  installed.
  A link to java: java.sun.com, and
  a link to dot: www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz

  In the variable PATH must be included a reference to the location of the 
  program "dot".

  After this: again run "./configure". You will get the message 
    "Java and grappa are found"
  and run "make install" thereafter.
